# Istanbul Traffic Analysis

## üö¶ Project Overview

This project explores **whether traffic patterns in Istanbul are influenced more by weather conditions, time factors, district location, or seasonal events**. 

By analyzing **traffic and weather data**, we aim to understand what factors most significantly impact traffic congestion in one of the world's most congested cities.

### **Factors Being Analyzed**

* **Weather Conditions** ‚Äì How do precipitation, temperature, and other weather variables affect traffic density and average speeds?
* **Temporal Patterns** ‚Äì Do rush hours, weekdays vs. weekends, or specific time periods show distinctive traffic patterns?
* **District Location** ‚Äì Are certain districts consistently more congested? Do they respond differently to other variables?
* **Seasonal Effects** ‚Äì Are there weekly or monthly patterns in traffic behavior that can be identified?

To analyze this, we collected and combined **traffic data from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IBB)** with **weather data from WeatherAPI.com**, examining how these factors interrelate and influence traffic conditions.

By identifying these patterns, we aim to provide insights that can help improve traffic management and urban planning in Istanbul.

## üö¶ Research Questions and Objectives

* Determine which factors (weather, time, location) have the strongest influence on Istanbul's traffic patterns
* Identify statistically significant relationships between specific weather conditions and traffic metrics
* Discover natural groupings and patterns in traffic data that may not be immediately apparent
* Apply advanced data science techniques including hypothesis testing, clustering, and dimensionality reduction to extract meaningful insights from traffic data
* Develop data-driven recommendations for traffic management and urban planning based on the findings

## üö¶ Motivation

Istanbul faces significant traffic congestion issues, consistently ranking among the world's most congested cities. Understanding the factors that affect traffic patterns is crucial for:

* Improving traffic management strategies
* Guiding urban planning and infrastructure development
* Enhancing public transportation systems
* Reducing economic costs associated with congestion
* Improving quality of life for Istanbul residents

This project applies data science techniques to generate actionable insights that can contribute to addressing these challenges.

## üö¶ Datasets & Data Collection

### Traffic Data
* **Source**: Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (IBB) Open Data Portal
* **Metrics**: Traffic density, average speed, vehicle count
* **Coverage**: Hourly data from various districts

### Weather Data
* **Source**: WeatherAPI.com 
* **Metrics**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, weather condition
* **Coverage**: Hourly weather data for Istanbul

Both datasets were collected through API calls, cleaned, and merged to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

## üö¶ Hypotheses and Testing

1.  **H‚ÇÅ**: There is a significant difference in traffic density between weekdays and weekends.
    *   **Test Used**: Independent t-test
    *   **Result**: p-value = 0.448 (Not significant at Œ±=0.05)
    *   **Conclusion**: Failed to reject the null hypothesis. No statistically significant difference found.
2.  **H‚ÇÇ**: Weather conditions have a significant effect on average traffic speed.
    *   **Test Used**: One-way ANOVA
    *   **Result**: p-value = 0.313 (Not significant at Œ±=0.05)
    *   **Conclusion**: Failed to reject the null hypothesis. Weather conditions do not significantly affect average speed.
3.  **H‚ÇÉ**: There is a significant correlation between precipitation and traffic density.
    *   **Test Used**: Pearson correlation
    *   **Result**: Correlation = 0.091, p-value = 0.015 (Significant at Œ±=0.05)
    *   **Conclusion**: Rejected the null hypothesis. There is a weak but statistically significant positive correlation.
4.  **H‚ÇÑ**: Rush hours show significantly different congestion patterns compared to non-rush hours.
    *   **Test Used**: Independent t-test
    *   **Result**: p-value = 0.244 (Not significant at Œ±=0.05)
    *   **Conclusion**: Failed to reject the null hypothesis. No statistically significant difference found.

## üö¶ Dataset Analysis Plan

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   * Clean and merge traffic and weather datasets
   * Handle missing values and outliers
   * Create temporal features (hour of day, day of week, etc.)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   * Visualize traffic patterns by time of day and day of week
   * Examine relationships between weather variables and traffic metrics
   * Create correlation heatmaps to identify important relationships

3. **Advanced Analysis**:
   * Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify key patterns
   * Conduct cluster analysis to discover natural traffic pattern groups
   * Perform seasonal decomposition to understand weekly patterns
   * Generate district-based heatmaps to understand geographical patterns

4. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   * Conduct statistical tests on key relationships
   * Validate or reject initial hypotheses
   * Document significance levels and effect sizes

## üö¶ Tools and Technologies

- **Python 3.x** (Primary programming language)
- **Data Manipulation**: pandas, numpy
- **Data Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, folium
- **Statistical Analysis**: scipy, statsmodels
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Data Collection**: requests (API interactions)

## üö¶ Analysis and Key Findings

### Traffic Patterns by Time
- Distinct patterns observed: Morning Rush (7-10 AM) and Evening Rush (4-7 PM) show higher density, especially weekdays. Weekends generally lower density with different peaks.

### Weather Impact on Traffic
- **Precipitation**: Statistically significant positive correlation with traffic density (r=0.091, p=0.015).
- **Temperature & Conditions**: No significant direct effect on average speeds, though different conditions show varying patterns.

### District-Based Analysis
- Different districts exhibit distinct congestion patterns, influenced by location-specific characteristics.

### Cluster Analysis Results
- Two distinct clusters identified:
    - **Cluster 0**: Lower density, higher speeds (free-flowing).
    - **Cluster 1**: Higher density, lower speeds (congested), more frequent during rush hours and in high-density districts.

### Summary of Key Findings
- Significant positive correlation between precipitation and traffic density.
- Two distinct traffic pattern clusters discovered.
- Varying congestion patterns across different districts.
- Weekly seasonality detected in traffic patterns.
